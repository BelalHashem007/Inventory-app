# Inventory-application

    Making an application using express and postgres to store items like books and show them based on genre.
    You can do all the CRUD(Create/Read/Update/Delete) operation on them.
    This project was mainly for practicing how to make a database schema for a library like app (books/genre/author) and their relations to each other.
